# GenLink

GenLink is a web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that generates deep links for YouTube videos. These links open directly in the YouTube mobile app instead of a web browser, making it easier for content creators and social media users to share videos in Instagram stories. This encourages users to subscribe and like videos more efficiently by directly redirecting them to the YouTube app.
